# LUP4LDN Frontend
## Overview

The Land Use Planning for Land Degradation Neutrality (LUP4LDN) tool allows users to formulate and evaluate Land Use (LU) and Land Management (LM) transition scenarios, providing visual representations of impacts (LD gains and losses) and trade-offs towards achieving land degradation neutrality (LDN).
The tool allows users to organise their Land Use plan under Projects, where users collaborate on the definition of their plans and can observe the corresponding results on Land Degradation.
The repository provides the complete codebase for the tool, including the following functions:

- Project creation and configuration
- Incorporation of country-level LDN-related information
- Visualisation of Country-level prospects for Population, Climatic Variables and Vegetation Indices
- Mapped and diagrammatic representation of LDN indicators such as Land Cover, Soil Organic Carbon stocks, Vegetation Productivity, and the UN SDG15.3.1 Land Degradation Indicator

Furthermore, the LUP4LDN Frontend exposes all functionality related to the collaborative creation of Land Use Plans via the assessment of the current state on the LUP focus area - covering two LUP methods based on Land Use Suitability and Land Management Sustainabiity approaches respectively - and using customisable Transition Impact Matrices in combination with SLM practices to build and estimate the impact of the plans.
